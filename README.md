## AUTOMATION PYTHON PROGRAM

It checks all the files in **path_source** folder
and is moved to corresponding folder based on its type/extension

The target file is set inside the functions
_you can change it according to your need_

The file _(eg., file with .txt extension)_ will be moved to the target folder _(text folder I created ! )_
### HOW TO RUN ?
Inorder to run, open **main.py**

an exception is added to the folder named **'MagicalPy'**, no effect will
be taken inside the files

Thanks !
